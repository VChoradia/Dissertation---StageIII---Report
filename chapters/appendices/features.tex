\chapter{Features of the System}
\label{app:features}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Categorizing the Features} \\
    All the features of the system are categorized into functional and non-functional features.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Functional Features} \\
    Functional features represent the capabilities and behaviours of a system that directly contribute to its primary purpose and functionality. These features are concerned with what the system does and how well it performs its intended tasks.

        \item \textbf{Non-Functional Features} \\
    Non-functional features, on the other hand, are characteristics of a system that do not directly relate to its specific functionalities but rather focus on how well the system performs its functions. 
    
    \end{itemize}
     	
    \item \textbf{MoSCoW Prioritisation FrameWork}\\
    After categorizing features into functional and non-functional, they are prioritized using the MoSCoW Prioritisation FrameWork. The key for this prioritisation is given in Table \ref{tab:key-to-features}.
