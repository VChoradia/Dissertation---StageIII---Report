\chapter{Stress and Fatigue Level}
\section{Stress Level:}
Stress is a complex physiological and psychological response to external pressures or demands, commonly experienced in high-stress environments such as healthcare settings. Measuring stress levels involves assessing the body's reaction to stressors, which can manifest in various ways, including changes in heart rate, hormonal balance, and nervous system activity. The challenge lies in quantifying stress in real-time due to its multifaceted nature.\\
\section{Fatigue Level:}
Fatigue, often synonymous with tiredness, is a state of extreme tiredness or exhaustion, that impacts both physical and mental capacities. In healthcare professionals working in demanding environments, fatigue can compromise decision-making abilities, reaction times, and overall performance. Like stress, fatigue is a nuanced parameter that requires a comprehensive understanding of physiological and psychological factors.
