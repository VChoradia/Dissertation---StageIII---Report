\chapter{Conclusion}

With the imperative need for healthcare monitoring for healthcare professionals, this project aims to provide a solution where all the HCPs can be monitored non-intrusively and provide a centralized dashboard for the healthcare institutions to monitor the same. For this, the project will delve into two things:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Development of Smart Patch:} Smart Patch will be an IoT device built on ESP32, sending real-time heart beat rate and body temperature of HCP using Pimoroni Pulse Sensor and LM-35 Sensor, over Wi-Fi to the dashboard; programmed in MicroPython. 
    \item \textbf{Development of Dashboard:} Dashboard will be a web interface developed in MERN stack technology providing real-time vitals information provided by the Smart Patch to healthcare institutions. 
\end{itemize}

 The project has surveyed the current methodologies, and technology which will be used to build the Smart Patch and the dashboard. \\

\noindent In the next phase of the project, the whole system will be designed, implemented and tested thoroughly and will be evaluated and delivered. Along with this, a few interviews will be conducted with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions.
