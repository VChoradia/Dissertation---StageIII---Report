\chapter*{\Large \center Acknowledgement}

I am profoundly grateful to my supervisor, Prof. Hamish Cunningham, for his invaluable guidance and inspiration throughout this project. His expertise in the Internet of Things, as demonstrated in the COM3505 module, significantly enhanced my understanding and passion for IoT applications in healthcare. I also extend my thanks to Gareth Coleman, the visiting academic for the module, whose practical insights were immensely helpful. My appreciation goes to Dr. Matt Elis, my second marker, whose constructive feedback helped refine my work, and to the Electronics Lab team—Cecil Wilkinson and Dr. Tom Howard—whose patience and expertise were crucial in overcoming the technical challenges I faced. Additionally, I acknowledge the Department of Computer Science for providing the necessary facilities and resources. \\

\noindent A special thank you to Siya Pradhan, a dear friend whose support and companionship were invaluable during this journey, keeping me sane and motivated through the ups and downs of this dissertation. \\

\noindent And last but most importantly, I am also thankful to my family and all my friends for their endless encouragement and belief in my abilities.
